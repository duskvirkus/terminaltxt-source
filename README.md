# TerminalTXT

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/figraham/terminaltxt-source.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/figraham/terminaltxt-source)
[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/terminaltxt.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/terminaltxt)

This is a web based creative coding library / game engine for ASCII and text art reminiscent of Terminal graphics.

## Examples

Examples are hosted through github pages and you can view live examples by using the links below.

If you'd like to experiment with the examples then it's recommended that you clone the individual repositories. Then run change into the root directory of the project and run `npm i` then you can run `npm start` and the example will be available through a local server at [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234). You can change the code within the src directory and the changes will automatically reload.

List of Examples:

- Hello World - [Repository](https://github.com/figraham/terminaltxt-helloworld) - [Live Example](https://figraham.github.io/terminaltxt-helloworld/)


## Documentation

Hosting documentation through github pages has been spotty so while that's being figured out the best way to view documentation is through a local server.

You'll need something like http-server which can easily be installed with npm using `npm i -g http-server` if you have npm which is included in [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

```
git clone https://github.com/figraham/terminaltxt-source.git
cd terminaltxt-source/docs
http-server
```

Then you can navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) with your favorite browser.
